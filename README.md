# inertia
A game about rocket science

# Server
To start server, run `lua server.lua`

# Client
To start client, go to client and run `love .`

# Multiplayer
By default, client will connect to my server if internet is available

# IRC
There is an IRC channel `#inertia-game@freenode.net`. That's probably the best
place to message me if the server is down.

# Console
